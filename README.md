#### It seems this colab is not working due to the updated google colab again, I am working on one subject now and plan to fix it by the end of Jan 2025. If someone has already handled it, many thanks for your sharing.

Many thanks to [kohya-trainer](https://github.com/Linaqruf/kohya-trainer) and [StitchDiffusion](https://github.com/littlewhitesea/StitchDiffusion) for their open-source code.
